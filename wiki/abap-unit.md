## Class Double (Interface)
[SAP Help](https://help.sap.com/docs/abap-cloud/abap-development-tools-user-guide/abap-oo-test-double-framework?locale=en-US)

A slightly different approach is possible if the object under test directly uses the DOC. The DOC has to be a non-final ABAP class. In this case it is possible to implement a test-specific subclass as a test double.

## TEST-SEAM
